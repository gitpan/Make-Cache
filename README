1.2 Summary
===========

Make::Cache provides packages and the objcache program to cache the
results of compiler runs, so that later identical source code can be
recompiled instantaneously.

1.3 Description
===============

Make::Cache provides packages and programs to support caching of
Makefile targets, mostly the outputs of compiler runs.

   The main interface is the objcache program.  By simply prepending

   objcache -read -write

   before any GCC compile lines in a makefile, you get instant
recompilation of source files.

   Objcache also allows for distributing parallel make jobs across
multiple machines in a server farm.

1.4 Obtaining Distribution
==========================

The latest version is available at `http://www.perl.org/CPAN/'

1.5 Supported Systems
=====================

This version of Make::Cache has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any system with Perl and GCC.  It may be easily
modified to support other compilers.
